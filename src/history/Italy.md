I recently spent a week in Italy and I would like to share with you guys my experience there. It is a beautiful country with stunning architecture and loads of history to learn about but it is facing the threats brought by the global mass immigration policy. It saddens me to see a great country changing this much in such a short period of time.

On the bright side, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has brought light to the rising poverty and crime rate in major cities across the EU. His attempt at saving the situation with "Italy First" and anti-migrant policies have also received mixed reactions from his citizens.

Mass immigration is always backed with the glorious promise, "Diversity is a strength". This is the ultimate lie the left has been feeding everyone in the world. Backed by statistics, we discuss the problem we are actually facing under mass immigration and refuge policies in the EU.
