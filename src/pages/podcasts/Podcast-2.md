My second podcast recorded with Ahmed.
This time we are focusing on a single topic - Artificial Intelligence!
Discussing the good, the bad and the ugly aspects of it.

Including AI assistance in medicine and personal life, massive surveillance and collection of data and the possibilities of AI taking over the world!

It is our second Podcast, therefore, we are still polishing it up. I do believe that this time it was a lot better!

Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

I love you all and you are the best!

Thank you for listening!
