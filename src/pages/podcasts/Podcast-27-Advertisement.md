Episode 27 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing Advertisement!

Online advertisement has become an integral part of our lives and is getting bigger and more intrusive.

Do you like advertisement? What are your issues with it if you have some!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on YouTube every Sunday @ 7pm!
