Episode 16 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are reviewing 2018. Most memorable moments that happened in this crazy year.

This is our fourth attempt at doing it Live so please excuse all technical issues!

Let us know what you think about the visual overlay this time. I really like it!

We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your feedback is greatly appreciated!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on Youtube every Sunday @ 7pm!
