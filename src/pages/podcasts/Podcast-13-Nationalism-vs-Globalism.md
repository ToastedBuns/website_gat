Episode 13 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing Nationalism and Globalism and the impact of Trump's America First mentality.

This is our first attempt at doing it Live so please excuse all technical issues!

We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your feedback is greatly appreciated!

I love you all and you are the best!
