This time we are talking about Video games. Both of us have been fans of video games since childhood and we actually met at university during Video Games Technologies Bachelor course.

In this episode we discuss our favourite games, the current state of the industry and where itâ€™s heading. Including new business models like microtransactions and loot boxes.

Talking about Splinter Cell, Need for Speed, Hitman series and many more! In addition to talking about our favourite video games we also discuss Political Correctness slowly creeping into video games.

Especially after the announcement of Battlefield V and the backlash it received from the gamers.

Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

I love you all and you are the best!
