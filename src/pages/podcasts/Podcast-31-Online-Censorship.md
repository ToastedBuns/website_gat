Episode 31 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing the censorship of conservative voices on the internet.

Facebook just banned Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer and everything Info Wars.

Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!
