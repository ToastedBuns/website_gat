Episode 33 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing Game Of Thrones!

Season 8 just finished and the reception from the fanbase was mixed at best. Tune in to see what we thought about it!

Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on YouTube every Sunday @ 7pm!
