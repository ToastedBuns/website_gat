After taking a short break, Toasted Buns Podcast is back! This time we are discussing the possibility of living in a simulation!

Elon Musk, Neil Degrasse Tyson and many more scientist and phylosophers have been toying with the idea of us living in a simulation, but does it have any ground at all?

Check out our thoughts on this topic!

We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your
feedback is greatly appreciated!
I love you all and you are the best!
