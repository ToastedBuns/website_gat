Episode 23 of Toasted Buns Podcast.
This time we are discussing living in a big city vs living in a small city!

Is it better to live in a big Metropolitan city or a smaller one? Maybe even the suburbs?

What are the pros and cons of both? Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!
I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on Youtube every Sunday @ 7pm!
