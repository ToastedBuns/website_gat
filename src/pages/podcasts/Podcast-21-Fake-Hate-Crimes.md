Ahmed still has no internet so it's just me again tonight!

Episode 21 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time I am discussing the new phenomena that is happening in the US - Fake Hate Crimes (Coming to UK Soon I'm sure)

With the most recent fake hate crime of that gay black actor from empire that nobody knows I wanted to dive deeper into past examples and what it means going forward. Be assured that the fake news media also known as Mainstream Media has a big part to play in this too!

Let us know what you think in the comments below!
