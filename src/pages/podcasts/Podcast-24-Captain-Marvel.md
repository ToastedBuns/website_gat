Episode 24 of Toasted Buns Podcast.
This time we are discussing Captain Marvel and other SJW Bullshit coming from Disney

What is going at Marvel and Disney?
Did they not learn after the disaster that was The Last Jedi?
Why is Marvel dipping into the feminist controversy?
Is Captain Marvel as bad as people say? Let us know what you think in the comments below!
