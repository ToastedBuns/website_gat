Episode 34 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing what does it mean to exist?

Do you have free will or you are just a NPC living in a simulation?

I got the wrong playlist on Spotify so the music in the background is not a usual one.
Also YouTube went down for whatever reason so if there was any issues please forgive us!

Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on YouTube every Sunday @ 7pm!
