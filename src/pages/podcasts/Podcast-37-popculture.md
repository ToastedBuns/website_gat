Episode 37 of Toasted Buns Podcast

This time we are discussing Pop Culture.

The pop culture in 2019 is getting crazier and crazier. We will discuss the worst cases and what we can do about it!

Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on YouTube every Sunday @ 7pm!
