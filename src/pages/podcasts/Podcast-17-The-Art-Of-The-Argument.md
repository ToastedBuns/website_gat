Episode 17 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing The art of The Argument (inspired by the book of the same title by Stefan Molyneux).

We have seen a decline in free speech and the quality of debates in recent memory.

Many people have been denied the possibility to even speak in some universities and we want to discuss the reasons behind it and the implications of this.

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues! We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your feedback is greatly appreciated! I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on Youtube every Sunday @ 7pm!
