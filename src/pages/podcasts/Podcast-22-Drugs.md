Ahmed should be back tonight!

Episode 22 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing drugs!

Should it be decriminalized? Is it good for you or is it really bad for you as individual? What about the society?

Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues! We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your feedback is greatly appreciated! I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on Youtube every Sunday @ 7pm!
