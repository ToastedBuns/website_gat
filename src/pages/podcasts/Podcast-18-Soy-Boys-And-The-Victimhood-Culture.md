Episode 18 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing Soy Boys and the rise of the Victimhood Culture.

We have seen the decline of masculinity and the rise of weak soy boys. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues! We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your feedback is greatly appreciated! I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on Youtube every Sunday @ 7pm!
