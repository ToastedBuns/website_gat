Episode 28 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing Julian Assange and his arrest!

Julian Assange was arrested recently and it's very likely he will be extradited to the US and put into prison...

Is he a hero or a villain and what does this mean to journalism?

Let us know what you think in the comments below!
