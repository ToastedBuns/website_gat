Episode 26 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing our favorite YouTubers!

YouTube has become an important part of our lives and we wanted to share the creators and channels on YouTube that we follow and watch their content!

What are you favorite creators on YouTube?

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on YouTube every Sunday @ 7pm!
