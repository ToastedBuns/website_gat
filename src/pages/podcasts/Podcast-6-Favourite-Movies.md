This time we are talking about our favourite movies. Going through our
Top 10 with some honourable mentions including Mad Max, Fight Club, The
Matrix and many more!

We wanted to have a more chill session this time talking about something
we both really enjoy.

We are toasting some more serious discussions, but
I believe that you need to talk about something that is inspiring too!
We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your
feedback is greatly appreciated!

I love you all and you are the best!
