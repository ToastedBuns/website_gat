Episode 35 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing the importance of privacy and how to balance your privacy online and the convenient tools that you use everyday.

With the rise of Silicon Valley giants and their draconian privacy policies the importance of Privacy is coming back into political and social debate. But how can you protect yourself and still enjoy all the benefits of these corporations knowing everything about you?

Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on YouTube every Sunday @ 7pm!
