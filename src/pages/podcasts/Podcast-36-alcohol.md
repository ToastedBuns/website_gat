Episode 36 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing Alcohol.

We all like to have a nice drink once in a while but how good or bad alcohol truly is? Tune in to see our thoughts on it!

Let us know what you think in the comments below!

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on YouTube every Sunday @ 7pm!
