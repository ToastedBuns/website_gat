Episode 25 of Toasted Buns Podcast.

This time we are discussing the events that took place in New Zealand over the weekend.

It is still an on going case so many things can change very quickly but I believe that it is important to understand what happened and why he did what he did. We will not show his face or use his name but we will discuss his manifesto and some of the ideas that led to this event.

We are still trying to figure out how to do Live Podcasts as good as we can so please excuse all technical issues!

I love you all and you are the best!

Make sure you join us Live on Youtube every Sunday @ 7pm!
