Western society has been working very hard to bridge the gap between men
and women in workplaces for many decades now. There are laws that
prevent employers from paying their employees less based on gender,
women are encouraged to postpone settling down and creating a family for
career.

Women are occupying top positions in biggest companies, like
Susan Wojcicki who is the CEO of Youtube or Kathleen Kennedy who is the
President of Lucasfilm. There are many different awards for women in
tech for example Business Journal's 2017 Women in Technology Awards and
many more. Moreover, women have been appointed to many top positions in
politics too. Theresa May is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,
Dalia Grybauskaite has been the president of Lithuania since 2009 and
many more.

However, the mainstream media is still claiming that our society is a
sexist patriarchy that is working only in favour of men and women are a
marginalized minority. How true is that?

Women in tech issue have been on the front pages of the news for years
now. For some reason, the mainstream media is pushing the narrative that
this industry is very sexist and more women need to get into the
industry. Even though women are more interested in people, not things
and prefer working in more humanitarian areas. Many tech companies are
trying so hard to meet the quotas that it is really getting out of hand.

One thing I do not understand is why men in the nursery are not
receiving even half of the attention that women in tech are? Majority of
teachers in early years schools are women. And it’s not 40/60 ratio. Oh
no no, 98% of teachers in the early years are women (This is in the UK,
might be different in other countries, but I would assume the majority
is still women). Where is the outrage of the Twitter mob about this
issue? Oh, the inequality only matters when women are the minority. I
suppose the oppressor cannot be the oppressed one. How convenient!

In addition to being a minority in some industries, men are faced with a
higher risk of dying at work. In 2017/18 96% (!!) of all fatal injuries
at work were to male workers. I am not advocating for any injuries at
all, because they are terrible, but why are we not talking about this
inequality? Oh, I guess men are the oppressors so they do not matter.
On the other hand, I do agree with 3rd wave feminists that some
industries are still dominated by men and that needs to change. A recent
LinkedIn analysis found that women make up just 26.7% of all oil and gas
industry profiles on the professional networking site. That is
unacceptable.

I think that we should get that number to 50/50 and the
only way to do that is to send women to oil mining sites! This amazing
industry offers everything women love:

- Terrible working environment
- Grave danger
- Going away from your family for a long time

And much more!
In addition to this, we should close the gender gap in other industries
too:

- Mail delivery
- Trash collection
- Mining
- Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanics
- Bricklaying

Unfortunately, I do not see any campaigning or any protest against
companies in these industries to employ more women. Maybe because these
jobs are hard, usually involve long hours and not the highest pay. I
wonder why women only want to overtake Silicon Valley and CEO positions
only.

Lastly, I just want to ask one question about Women in Tech rewards.
I recently received an invitation to nominate someone for one. But that
got me thinking! Using the logic of liberals, who say that anyone who
‘believes that they are opposite gender’ is correct and should be
respected. Therefore my question is: “If I feel like a woman on
Wednesdays, can I apply for the Women in Tech award?”. I honestly do not
know the answer to this, but we have seen a transgender woman winning
Miss Universe Award in Spain, and an activist who applied to be a
women's officer for Labour party because he "identifies as a woman on
Wednesdays." So why am I any different? Please let me know!

In the end, gender inequality is real. But is it a bad thing? Is it
really a result of evil patriarchy? Or is it a result of free will of
the people? The research is pointing to the fact that women, on average,
prefer working with people. That is why majority of midwives, early
school teachers and nurses are women. And there is nothing wrong with
that! Just like there is nothing wrong with majority of engineer,
software developers and bricklayers being men.
