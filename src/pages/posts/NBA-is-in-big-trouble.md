For the last decade NBA has been receiving a lot of criticism for its lack of competitiveness. Lebron James led his teams to 8 straight (Heat and Cavaliers) NBA finals (which is impressive I have to admit) and met Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs (twice) and GSW (last 4 seasons). That means that in the last 8 years only 6 teams have played in the NBA finals. And only two in the last 4 years.

When Kevin Durant decided to leave Oklahoma which was ahead of Golden State Warriors 3-1 in the Western Conference finals, before losing, and to join the same Golden State Warriors who defeated him I was mad. Everyone was mad. Everybody knew what this meant. Golden State Warriors will win the championship. And they did. And then we knew that they will win again. And they did. However, the Houston managed to put a fight, other teams were getting better so there was hope even though the excitement for NBA was dying.
It died today.

This morning I woke up to the news that another All-star Demarcus Cousins is joining the Warriors for basically a bag of peanuts (\$5mln dollars for Cousins is a joke). Golden State Warriors now have a starting five which contains 5 all stars. This has not been done since 1970s when Celtics were dominating. 5 all-stars in the team. What the hell is going on? What are we supposed to be excited about for the next season? Will the warriors lose at least once in the playoff?

Demarcus Cousins is the biggest sellout I have ever seen. Even worse than Kevin Durant aka the snake. Cousins joined Pelicans and had a good team around him. He had Rondon, Holiday and Anthony Davis. He was part of a team that won 6th seed in the West and swept the blazers WITHOUT HIM. AD wore his jersey in the All-Star game to show his support for him. What does DC do after all of that? LEAVES TO GSW! Are you kidding me?! What happened to competitive nature of this sport? This has to be the most disrespectful move in NBA history. PATHETIC Demarcus. You are Pathetic.

NBA is in big trouble. Adam Silver needs to do something drastic. This cannot continue anymore! I am so sick of seeing Golden State in the finals and it’s not stopping anytime soon. I don’t know how this can be fixed, but it has to be done. Adam Silver this is your time to shine. You need to come up with a way to stop these superteams. Put 500% tax for every \$ that goes over the salary cap, that will stop those damn owners and GMs from overspending.

In addition to Golden State dominating for the last 4 years and the foreseeable future the East conference has been garbage for the last 20-30 years. And it is only getting worse every year. The MVP of the last 5 years is from the West. How telling is that? There has been 3 MVP winners from the East in the last 18 years. Iverson, Lebron and D Rose. That is it. And the last team to win NBA championship from the East that does not have Lebron James in the roster was Celtics in 2008. For the last 10 years it was either Lebron or the West. FIX IT NBA!

I have been thinking about changing the play offs to be Top 16 teams of the regular season despite the conferences, but I don’t know if this drastic change is the right thing to do. The rich history of NBA will be altered forever. The rivalry between the conferences, even though it’s been weak for the last few decades, still has a great appeal for everyone. In addition to this, if no team from the East side of the USA makes the Finals, the appeal of NBA in half of the country will diminish.

I love NBA. It is the best basketball league in the world with the best players. But what has been going on for the last ten years or so is unacceptable! This needs to be fixed now. NBA is in a desperate need of tough decisions from the executives and especially Mr. Silver. You inherited one of the greatest entertainment business in the world of sports from Mr. Stern. You will either make it better or it will be overtaken by other more competitive sports. The clock is ticking NBA and it is definitely not in your favour.
