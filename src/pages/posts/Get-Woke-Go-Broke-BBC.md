The British Broadcasting Corporation, also known, as BBC is the most racist organization in the United Kingdom. It constantly focuses on the skin colour of the people they hire, work with and present to the consumers. Moreover, in the last couple years, it has become even more radical against white people. I am going to show a few examples of BBC blatant racism against white people and the bigotry of low expectations towards minorities.

First of all, let's look into a story from 2016 where I noticed the racism from BBC on full display. In 2016 BBC decided to hire more interns for the company, which, on the first sight, is a good thing. However, once applied people received a worrying email from BBC, saying that "The positions are only open to those from black, Asian and other ethnic minority backgrounds who are passionate about getting into Drama script editing.".

Just like that, executives at BBC decided to not hire people based solely on their skin colour. But maybe this is for a specific on-screen role that requires the person to be a specific ethnicity you might say and if that was the case, I wouldn't be so worried, but it was for script writing and office job where your appearance makes no difference. This is what BBC had to say on the matter: "The move was to address an 'under-representation of people from ethnic minority backgrounds in script editing roles". Turning down the applicants because of their skin colour! Imagine if it was any other ethnicity, BBC would be set on fire by the Twitter mob, but in this instance, BBC was held as some kind of heroic organization standing up to the white supremacy.

Does BBC think that people from ethnic minorities are not capable to outcompete the other candidates and get the job? That sounds pretty racist to me. I support the free market and competition. Hire the best candidate you can find, not the one that will meet the quotas you have created for yourself.

Secondly, we have the situation of Jon Holmes who was fired from his radio show after 18 years. Now you might think that he got old and no one was listening to his show and that's why he got fired. Again, you would be wrong! He got fired because he was a white man, of course! When he got fired by the BBC, they told him that he is being fired because it was being recast with “more women and diversity”. This is what he had to say about the issue: “If we are now openly giving jobs to people based on the colour of their skin, surely that is only emphasising just the kind of social division that the equality that I was brought up to embrace strives to eliminate? So what if – and I know this is radical – but what if everything and every job in all walks of life were open to everyone equally, and we all just agree that everyone’s the same, by which I mean – you know – ‘human’?”. BBC is becoming a radical far-left organization and is punishing people not based on what they did or how competent they are, but solely based on their skin colour and gender.

Thirdly and most recently, the BBC's top executive said: "Era of TV With White Men Imparting Knowledge is Over". Again, the emphasis is on the skin colour and the gender. Not the content. BBC Four editor Cassian Harrison, an upper middle-class white male, told the Edinburgh Television Festival that people are no longer interested in “static” television programmes featuring a white male presenter talking about a topic. Earlier this year the former head of BBC Comedy, Shane Allen, said a production like Monty Python with a cast of “six Oxbridge white blokes” would not be commissioned today, explaining that the corporation is instead intent on hiring people “who reflect the modern world”.

Speaking after a number of comedy programmes fronted by women and ethnic minorities were unveiled, Allen pointed to the relatively unknown recent BBC 3 sketch show Famalam, the whole cast of which is black, to highlight the corporation’s “diverse” new content. I love that he uses a show that the whole cast is black as an example of diversity. It's like the idea of diversity actually means less white people. Very diverse indeed. In addition to this, BBC bosses want more journalists from ethnic minorities to present the news in a bid for bigger viewing figures. BBC believes that people do not watch the television for the content, but to simply see the people that look like them. Especially people from ethnic minorities. I believe that people want to see good content, no matter what skin colour they were born, what gender or sexuality, people want to see good content. Unfortunately, BBC has been focused more on diversity quotas and not the content, because the things BBC has produced lately is, to say the least, complete shit.

In the end, what can we do about this? STOP TV LICENSE! It's time to stop funding BBC with taxpayer money. Let's see how BBC can survive in the free market. BBC will have to compete against the biggest content producers and I don't think it will have time or money to virtue signal and be so racist against white people. They will have to adopt the meritocracy model or die. And I am a supporter of either outcome. BBC needs to get better or it needs to die. This cannot continue anymore. And if you are reading this and paying the TV License, please cancel it. It's not even a fanatic or an extreme thing to do. The number of TV License owners is declining. More and more young people are avoiding it to save money and are watching better content online! Stop watching the mainstream television because it is complete propaganda and fast food version of television. Now, more than ever, we have a variety of content providers to consume content - Amazon, Netflix, Youtube, HBO and many, many more. It's time to do your duty and stop supporting the organization that hates you because you were born with a particular skin colour or the wrong gender.
GET WOKE GO BROKE BBC!
