Hey everyone how's it going? Hope you are coping with the lockdown okay.

I just wanted to make a short video about this whole situation as the coronavirus exposed a few very important things that we need to discuss.

We are living under the most advanced and sophisticated authoritarian state. Yes, you can look at China and say wow it so much worse there but it is actually not true. People know how to behave in China. People know the rules and they know how to live within them. In the UK those rules are vague. Technically you have freedom of speech but you are not allowed to say anything about protected classes. You know who, I won't mention them. In here people are expected to conform without the government actually using any of it's powers. The tyranny is actually done through private sector instead of the government. For example, a lady fell asleep and didn't clap for the NHS. Ordinary people used social media to expose her and crucify her on the alter of public opinion. Moreover, we live under a 2 tier law system were indigenous people are treated as 2nd class citizens. Just look at how police treat local people who go to parks and other remote areas just to relax. They use the full power in their disposal: CCTVs, drones, intimidation and even arrests. You don't see them going to mosques and telling Muslims to go and stay at home.

Globalism and neo-liberalism caused this. Remember that this virus originated in China. Why is the UK one of the worst hit countries in the world? Well, most of the manufacturing that used to be done in the North moved to China. So most of the stuff that we buy is actually made in China. Even medical supplies like face masks are made there. Furthermore, Universities are reliant on Chinese students to survive and on top of that UK is one of the most biggest attraction for Chinese tourists. But it's not just the Chinese that are at fault. UK's government refused to closed down borders not for weeks but for months. While all the other countries were closing down borders and cracking down on the Chinese UK's government did nothing. It's own laze free economic model didn't allow it. On Week 6 of the lockdown, this government decided to start putting people who arrive into the United Kingdom on 14 day quarantine. A bit late don't you think? For 6 weeks we had 15 thousand people flying into the UK EVERY DAY plus hundreds of people coming in illegally every day. In a nutshell, this government put GDP and it's ideology above people. And even when the pandemic was hitting the country in terrible ways, UK's government allowed private businesses to bring cheap labor from eastern Europe to maximize the profits. Absolutely disgusting.

Conservative party is shallow and only cares about POWER. This crisis showed how Tories have no morals and no ideas. All they care about is winning elections. They will say whatever you want and blame Labor for their own faults. Unfortunately, people still fall for their lies. Priti Patel promised to stop all illegal immigration, she promised to reduce legal immigration and she did nothing. We are hitting all time records in illegal and legal migration and WE ARE IN A DAMN PANDEMIC. She is more focused on punishing people who are breaking down this lockdown than enforcing immigration laws. Boris Johnson is just saying things that nationalists want to hear but as soon as the media says anything he backtracks on his promises.

People need to stop and rethink their life choices. So many people are living paycheck to paycheck with no savings. No friends or family to rely on as well. Being literal wage slaves to the system. I've heard so many stories of people being afraid to be unemployed for just a few weeks and going to bankruptcy because of coronavirus. This is a terrible way to live. You should not take all this cheap credit and all this debt to buy things you don't need. Stop buying Sofas and TVs on credit cards. Start saving and become independent. Hopefully this crisis will be a wake up call to many people to rethink their life choices and unplug from this evil culture of usury. We can do better. We don't need to live in eternal cage of debt.

This one might be controversial but I have to get this off my chest. NHS has become a freaking cult. What the hell is going on. Stop dancing on tiktok it is becoming insufferable. Every time I see another one of those videos of those nurses dancing it makes me piss boil. And the fucking clapping at 8pm. Are you serious? Do you have no respect for yourself? What is going on? I am so sick of this worshipping of the NHS. Is this really the best you can do? The same NHS that buys paracetamol for 10Â£ a pack? The same NHS that hires Diversity officers for 50k a year (WORKING PART TIME BTW)? The same NHS were foreign doctors are responsible for 60% of all sexual assault cases? Yeah, I am not clapping for it. And I don't fucking care.

It's time to defund and destroy WHO and the UN. These are globalist, transnational organizations that are being used to destroy us. Everyone in those organizations are communists who hate Europeans and are in cahoots with China. I don't care what they say and I don't care what they think. I don't want to pay a single penny to these organizations. Anyone who still supports these useless organizations is an absolute fucking donut. Trump is right to defund WHO and he should defund the UN next. Every single country should simply stop paying and leave these places. They are useless and I hate them.

I think it is time to reopen the economy because people are tired. I personally don't know anyone who even has this virus. I am not saying that it is fake, I am 100% convince that this is a real threat but remember that being on a lockdown for months is not much better. We should allow young and healthy people to go back to work. If you are older or have some healthy issues - please stay at home. Don't be crazy and take all precautions necessary. However, Nevertheless, I should be allowed to go and visit my friends without being harassed by the police. I should be allowed to go to a park and chill as long as I am not in a huge crowd.

Once again, stay safe be smart and don't do anything stupid! See you next time

Oh and Fuck the celebrities and fuck the media. Fuck them all
