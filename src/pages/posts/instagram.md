Ah, Instagram! I know I have a problem with Instagram. It’s toxic and
ingenuine and it ruins my attention span. But it’s my guilty pleasure. I
just like to watch stories posted by my friends and some influencers I
don’t even like, then scroll through the feed until reality hits and I’d
realized 3 hours is gone.

But there is one thing that absolutely annoys me up to the roof - #tbt,
or just #tb when people feel “nostalgic” on a non-Thursday. I’m not
talking about a photo of you and your sister when you were 5 years old
playing in an inflatable pool in the backyard because those are cute and
(marginally) acceptable. I’m talking about constantly posting photos
from a vacation you took 3 years ago with friends you haven’t even seen
since that trip. Or photos from a work experience that happened 2 years
ago that you didn’t even enjoy or engage that much.

<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;"  data-ad-layout="in-article"  data-ad-format="fluid"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-2164900147810573"  data-ad-slot="8817307412"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>

And people usually get defensive about their decisions of doing such
moronic thing:
“Everyone does that.”
“It was fun, I missed that time.”
“I’m not happy about my current situation and wanted to post something
on my profile that could remind me of some good old days when I didn’t
have to worry about stuff”

…….

Explanations like these are as hollow and pointless as the posts
themselves. Rather than living your life by improving or fixing the
situation, you go on Instagram to moan about how life was easier when
you’re on a beach in a week-long trip to Malta and begs god to “bring
you back there”. It wasn't really “life” when you were on vacation,
though, was it? And we all know these kinds of posts with a lame ass
caption is only to make sure your 200 followers know that you’ve been to
the Grand Canyon sooo long ago that they could hardly recognise you from
the photos. People with this habit does not live in the present, they
live in bubbles of memories and it is not healthy.

Rant over.

With love,
